# Day 5: Material Preparation and Setup

## Overview

Today we focused on preparing materials for fabrication, learning about proper handling, setup procedures, and pre-fabrication checks.

## Activities Completed

### Morning Session
- Material handling and storage best practices
- Machine setup and calibration
- Pre-fabrication checklist

### Afternoon Session
- Hands-on material preparation
- Machine calibration exercise
- First fabrication attempt

## Process Documentation

### Step 1: Material Preparation
We learned proper material preparation techniques:

**For 3D Printing:**
1. **Filament Handling**
   - Proper storage to prevent moisture absorption
   - Checking for tangles or defects
   - Loading filament correctly into printer

2. **Bed Preparation**
   - Cleaning the build surface
   - Applying adhesion aids (if needed)
   - Leveling the print bed

**For Laser Cutting:**
1. **Material Inspection**
   - Checking for defects or warping
   - Verifying material thickness
   - Ensuring material is flat

2. **Machine Setup**
   - Focusing the laser
   - Setting power and speed parameters
   - Testing on scrap material

### Step 2: Machine Calibration
[Describe the calibration process you performed]

**Calibration Steps:**
1. **Bed Leveling** (for 3D printer)
   - Checked all four corners
   - Adjusted until consistent gap
   - Verified center point

2. **Extruder Calibration**
   - Measured actual vs. expected extrusion
   - Adjusted steps per millimeter
   - Tested with calibration cube

3. **Temperature Tuning**
   - Tested different temperatures
   - Found optimal settings for material
   - Documented settings for future use

### Step 3: First Fabrication
[Describe your first fabrication attempt]

**Process:**
1. **File Preparation**
   - Exported model in correct format
   - Generated G-code (for 3D printing) or cutting paths
   - Reviewed toolpaths for errors

2. **Fabrication Execution**
   - Loaded file into machine
   - Started fabrication process
   - Monitored initial layers/passes

3. **Quality Check**
   - Inspected first results
   - Identified issues
   - Made adjustments

**Challenges Encountered:**
- **Bed Adhesion Issues**: First layer not sticking properly
  - *Solution*: Adjusted bed temperature and first layer height
  
- **Calibration Accuracy**: Initial calibration wasn't precise enough
  - *Solution*: Repeated calibration with finer adjustments

**Solutions Applied:**
- Created calibration checklist
- Documented optimal settings
- Tested with small samples before full prints

## Key Learnings

1. **Preparation is Key**: Proper setup and calibration prevent most fabrication problems.

2. **Documentation Matters**: Recording settings and procedures saves time on future projects.

3. **Patience Required**: Calibration and setup take time but are essential for quality results.

## Reflection

Today's focus on preparation and setup reinforced the importance of attention to detail. I learned that rushing through setup leads to poor results, while taking time for proper calibration pays off in quality. The hands-on experience with machine calibration gave me confidence in operating the equipment.

I'm now understanding that fabrication is not just about pressing "print"—it's about understanding the entire process from material to finished part.
