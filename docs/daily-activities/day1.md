# Day 1: Introduction and Fundamentals

## Overview

Today marked the beginning of our Modeling and Fabrication Techniques journey. We were introduced to the fundamental concepts, tools, and safety protocols that will guide us throughout the course.

## Activities Completed

### Morning Session
- Course introduction and overview
- Safety briefing and lab orientation
- Introduction to fabrication tools and equipment

### Afternoon Session
- First hands-on exercise
- Basic tool familiarization
- Initial design concept discussion

## Process Documentation

### Step 1: Safety Orientation
We began with a comprehensive safety briefing covering:
- Personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements
- Tool safety protocols
- Emergency procedures
- Lab rules and regulations

### Step 2: Tool Introduction
We were introduced to various tools including:
- 3D printers and their operation
- Laser cutters and safety considerations
- Hand tools and their proper usage
- Measuring instruments

### Step 3: First Exercise
[Describe the first exercise you completed]

**Process:**
1. [Step 1 of your process]
2. [Step 2 of your process]
3. [Step 3 of your process]

**Challenges Encountered:**
- [Challenge 1 and how you overcame it]
- [Challenge 2 and how you overcame it]

**Solutions Applied:**
- [Solution 1]
- [Solution 2]

## Key Learnings

1. **Safety First**: Understanding that safety protocols are not optional but essential for successful fabrication work.

2. **Tool Familiarity**: Getting comfortable with the tools is the first step toward mastery.

3. **Design Thinking**: Beginning to understand how digital designs translate to physical objects.

## Reflection

Today was an exciting introduction to the world of modeling and fabrication. The safety briefing helped me understand the importance of proper procedures, and the hands-on introduction to tools sparked my curiosity about what we'll be able to create.

I'm looking forward to diving deeper into the modeling process and starting to create my first designs.
