## Course Reflection

### Skills Developed

**Technical Skills:**
- ✅ 3D modeling proficiency
- ✅ CAD software mastery
- ✅ Fabrication technique understanding
- ✅ Material knowledge
- ✅ Post-processing skills

**Process Skills:**
- ✅ Design thinking
- ✅ Problem-solving
- ✅ Iterative design
- ✅ Quality assessment

## Final Thoughts

This 9-day intensive course has been transformative. From learning the basics of 3D modeling to mastering fabrication techniques and finishing methods, I've gained skills and knowledge that will serve me well in future projects.

The hands-on approach, daily activities, and iterative learning process created an environment where I could truly understand not just the "how" but the "why" behind modeling and fabrication techniques.

I'm excited to continue applying these skills and exploring new possibilities in the world of digital fabrication.
